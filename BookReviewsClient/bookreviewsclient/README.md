# In order to run the project together with the backend service locally you need to host it on HTTPS
# below are two lines of commands you need to run the project locally
# trying to connect to azure backend service from your local machine won't work since you don't have exception for that
# (at least i hope so xd)

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `($env:HTTPS = "true") -and (npm start) `
